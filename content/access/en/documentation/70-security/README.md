# Security

openaccess.app is designed security first.

## Privacy Preserving

openaccess.app does not ask for or collect personally identifiable information.

## Operational Data

openaccess.app will ask for GPS data when in map mode.

The GPS data is only used to show the nearby venues.

The GPS data is not stored on the device and is not uploaded to the server.

### Optional

openaccess.app allows the creation of a user profile with the help of of provider ID (Apple ID, Google ID) in order to allow the user to store the data on the server in case the phone is lost or exchanged, but this is not required for the operation of the app.

openaccess.app does not keep event bookings after they have passed, unless the user chooses so. Passed event bookings are automatically deleted from the server. This reduces the possibility of user history and movements to be identified in case of a server breach.
