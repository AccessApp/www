## Privacy

openaccess.app is privacy preserving.

No personally identifiable information is uploaded to the server or sent to the venue.

All the information about the visit is deleted from the app and from the server at the end of the visit.

## Memories

If you'd like to keep the visits, you can set the "keep my visits" setting to "until the end of the day", "until the end of the month", "until the end of the year" or "indefinitely".

If you choose to do so, your data will never leave the server, will never be shown to anyone, and will not be processed in any way.

## Counters

openaccess.app keeps counters of performed activities.

The counters consist of a timestamp and the name of the activity.

An activity can be "A visit was booked."
